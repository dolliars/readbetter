          <p id="full-text" class="text">How you have felt, O men of Athens, at hearing the speeches
          of my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost made me
          forget who I was - such was the effect of them; and yet they have hardly spoken a word of
          truth. But many as their falsehoods were, there was one of them which quite amazed me; - I
          mean when they told you to be upon your guard, and not to let yourselves be deceived by
          the force of my eloquence. They ought to have been ashamed of saying this, because they
          were sure to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency; they
          certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this, unless by the force of eloquence
          they mean the force of truth; for then I do indeed admit that I am eloquent. But in how
          different a way from theirs! Well, as I was saying, they have hardly uttered a word, or
          not more than a word, of truth; but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however,
          delivered after their manner, in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No
          indeed! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am
          certain that this is right, and that at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before
          you, O men of Athens, in the character of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of
          me. And I must beg of you to grant me one favor, which is this - If you hear me using the
          same words in my defence which I have been in the habit of using, and which most of you
          may have heard in the agora, and at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I
          would ask you not to be surprised at this, and not to interrupt me. For I am more than
          seventy years of age, and this is the first time that I have ever appeared in a court of
          law, and I am quite a stranger to the ways of the place; and therefore I would have you
          regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native
          tongue, and after the fashion of his country; - that I think is not an unfair request.
          Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the justice of my
          cause, and give heed to that: let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly. And
          first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and then I will go
          to the later ones. For I have had many accusers, who accused me of old, and their false
          charges have continued during many years; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and
          his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are
          these, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their
          falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above,
          and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. These are
          the accusers whom I dread; for they are the circulators of this rumor, and their hearers
          are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they
          are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them in days
          when you were impressible - in childhood, or perhaps in youth - and the cause when heard
          went by default, for there was none to answer. And, hardest of all, their names I do not
          know and cannot tell; unless in the chance of a comic poet. But the main body of these
          slanderers who from envy and malice have wrought upon you - and there are some of them who
          are convinced themselves, and impart their convictions to others - all these, I say, are
          most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them up here, and examine them, and
          therefore I must simply fight with shadows in my own defence, and examine when there is no
          one who answers. I will ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my opponents
          are of two kinds - one recent, the other ancient; and I hope that you will see the
          propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations you heard long before
          the others, and much oftener. Well, then, I will make my defence, and I will endeavor in
          the short time which is allowed to do away with this evil opinion of me which you have
          held for such a long time; and I hope I may succeed, if this be well for you and me, and
          that my words may find favor with you. But I know that to accomplish this is not easy - I
          quite see the nature of the task. Let the event be as God wills: in obedience to the law I
          make my defence. I will begin at the beginning, and ask what the accusation is which has
          given rise to this slander of me, and which has encouraged Meletus to proceed against me.
          What do the slanderers say? They shall be my prosecutors, and I will sum up their words in
          an affidavit. "Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things
          under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he
          teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others." That is the nature of the accusation, and that
          is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes; who has introduced a man
          whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he can walk in the air, and talking a
          deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or
          little - not that I mean to say anything disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural
          philosophy. I should be very sorry if Meletus could lay that to my charge. But the simple
          truth is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to do with these studies. Very many of those
          here present are witnesses to the truth of this, and to them I appeal. Speak then, you who
          have heard me, and tell your neighbors whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in
          few words or in many upon matters of this sort. ... You hear their answer. And from what
          they say of this you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest. As little foundation
          is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take money; that is no more true than the
          other. Although, if a man is able to teach, I honor him for being paid. There is Gorgias
          of Leontium, and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities,
          and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens, by whom they might be
          taught for nothing, and come to them, whom they not only pay, but are thankful if they may
          be allowed to pay them. There is actually a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom
          I have heard; and I came to hear of him in this way: - I met a man who has spent a world
          of money on the Sophists, Callias the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons, I
          asked him: "Callias," I said, "if your two sons were foals or calves, there would be no
          difficulty in finding someone to put over them; we should hire a trainer of horses or a
          farmer probably who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and
          excellence; but as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is
          there anyone who understands human and political virtue? You must have thought about this
          as you have sons; is there anyone?" "There is," he said. "Who is he?" said I, "and of what
          country? and what does he charge?" "Evenus the Parian," he replied; "he is the man, and
          his charge is five minae." Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this
          wisdom, and teaches at such a modest charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proud
          and conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind. I dare say,
          Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Why is this, Socrates, and what is the
          origin of these accusations of you: for there must have been something strange which you
          have been doing? All this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had
          been like other men: tell us, then, why this is, as we should be sorry to judge hastily of
          you." Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavor to explain to you the
          origin of this name of "wise," and of this evil fame. Please to attend then. And although
          some of you may think I am joking, I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of
          Athens, this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess. If
          you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, such wisdom as is attainable by man, for to that
          extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking
          have a superhuman wisdom, which I may fail to describe, because I have it not myself; and
          he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men
          of Athens, I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something
          extravagant. For the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness
          who is worthy of credit, and will tell you about my wisdom - whether I have any, and of
          what sort - and that witness shall be the god of Delphi. You must have known Chaerephon;
          he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the exile of
          the people, and returned with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in
          all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether - as
          I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt - he asked the oracle to tell him whether
          there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no
          man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself, but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the
          truth of this story. Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I
          have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean?
          and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or
          great. What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god and
          cannot lie; that would be against his nature. After a long consideration, I at last
          thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man
          wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say
          to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest."
          Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed to him - his name
          I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination - and the result
          was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not
          really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went
          and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the
          consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present
          and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not
          suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than
          he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I
          know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him. Then
          I went to another, who had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was
          exactly the same. I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him. After this
          I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked, and
          I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me - the word of God, I thought,
          ought to be considered first. And I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know,
          and find out the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!
          - for I must tell you the truth - the result of my mission was just this: I found that the
          men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some inferior men were really
          wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the "Herculean" labors,
          as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When I
          left the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there,
          I said to myself, you will be detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant
          than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own
          writings, and asked what was the meaning of them - thinking that they would teach me
          something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I must say
          that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry
          than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write
          poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who
          also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. And the poets
          appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength
          of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which
          they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same
          reason that I was superior to the politicians.</p>
