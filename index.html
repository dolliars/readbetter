          How you have felt, O men of Athens, at hearing the speeches of my accusers, I cannot tell;
          but I know that their persuasive words almost made me forget who I was - such was the
          effect of them; and yet they have hardly spoken a word of truth. But many as their
          falsehoods were, there was one of them which quite amazed me; - I mean when they told you
          to be upon your guard, and not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of my eloquence.
          They ought to have been ashamed of saying this, because they were sure to be detected as
          soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency; they certainly did appear to be most
          shameless in saying this, unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth;
          for then I do indeed admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs!
          Well, as I was saying, they have hardly uttered a word, or not more than a word, of truth;
          but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner, in
          a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No indeed! but I shall use the words
          and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am certain that this is right, and
          that at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the
          character of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of me. And I must beg of you to
          grant me one favor, which is this - If you hear me using the same words in my defence
          which I have been in the habit of using, and which most of you may have heard in the
          agora, and at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I would ask you not to
          be surprised at this, and not to interrupt me. For I am more than seventy years of age,
          and this is the first time that I have ever appeared in a court of law, and I am quite a
          stranger to the ways of the place; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were
          really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the
          fashion of his country; - that I think is not an unfair request. Never mind the manner,
          which may or may not be good; but think only of the justice of my cause, and give heed to
          that: let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly.
