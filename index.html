          <p id="full-text" class="text"> How you have felt, O men of Athens, at hearing the
          speeches of my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost made
          me forget who I was - such was the effect of them; and yet they have hardly spoken a word
          of truth. But many as their falsehoods were, there was one of them which quite amazed me;
          - I mean when they told you to be upon your guard, and not to let yourselves be deceived
          by the force of my eloquence. They ought to have been ashamed of saying this, because they
          were sure to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency; they
          certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this, unless by the force of eloquence
          they mean the force of truth; for then I do indeed admit that I am eloquent. But in how
          different a way from theirs! Well, as I was saying, they have hardly uttered a word, or
          not more than a word, of truth; but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however,
          delivered after their manner, in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No
          indeed! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am
          certain that this is right, and that at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before
          you, O men of Athens, in the character of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of
          me. And I must beg of you to grant me one favor, which is this - If you hear me using the
          same words in my defence which I have been in the habit of using, and which most of you
          may have heard in the agora, and at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I
          would ask you not to be surprised at this, and not to interrupt me. For I am more than
          seventy years of age, and this is the first time that I have ever appeared in a court of
          law, and I am quite a stranger to the ways of the place; and therefore I would have you
          regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native
          tongue, and after the fashion of his country; - that I think is not an unfair request.
          Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the justice of my
          cause, and give heed to that: let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly. And
          first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and then I will go
          to the later ones. For I have had many accusers, who accused me of old, and their false
          charges have continued during many years; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and
          his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are
          these, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their
          falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above,
          and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. These are
          the accusers whom I dread; for they are the circulators of this rumor, and their hearers
          are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they
          are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them in days
          when you were impressible - in childhood, or perhaps in youth - and the cause when heard
          went by default, for there was none to answer. And, hardest of all, their names I do not
          know and cannot tell; unless in the chance of a comic poet. But the main body of these
          slanderers who from envy and malice have wrought upon you - and there are some of them who
          are convinced themselves, and impart their convictions to others - all these, I say, are
          most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them up here, and examine them, and
          therefore I must </p>
