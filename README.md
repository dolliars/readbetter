An experiment with presenting text online.

I'm generally frustrated with reading things on the internet. I appreciate
physical books because there is no mystery in the container. The moment I hold a
book and glance at a page, I have a sense of its concrete density. But while books
have that affordance, they lack flexibility. With webpages you can change so
many things: the font size, letter spacing, background and foreground colors,
typeface, etc. Yet I find myself always tweaking the way the text is presented
to me. I'm either adding a stylesheet, or using the inspector to modify the
page. And even with the modifications, I still find that I want a better
experience. I never know how long anything is and I find that annoying. The
scrollbar isn't very helpful, and often there are other noisy elements on a
page. The text on most pages seems rather small to me, even when I change
browser settings.

So yeah. This is just me experementing with things. And it definitely has errors
but I just wanted to try things out.
